# clustering-course
Subspace clustering and coclustering course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC-UNICAMP). I just want to collect repositories and useful materials for clustering course. Official site by Prof. Fernando Von Zuben and Rosana Veroneze [here](http://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~vonzuben/courses/ia376.html).

## Definition of Clustering:

Clustering or cluster analysis takes a mass of observations and separates them, using some measure of dissimilarity, into distinct groups called clusters (disjoint subsets of the whole dataset). Each group is expected to exhibit some internal homogeneity.

## Coding/Projects

Scikit learn package has many clustering algorithms implementation, you can see [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#hierarchical-clustering). How to install on Ubuntu 16.04 (needs numpy and scipy):

* Python 2.7

$ pip install -U scikit-learn

* Python 3.5

$ pip3 install -U scikit-learn
